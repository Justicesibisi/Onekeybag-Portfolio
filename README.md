Discussion of Process, Collaboration, and Timeline
Our collaboration was instrumental in the success of this project. We worked effectively as a team, leveraging our individual strengths to overcome challenges and meet deadlines. We utilized VS Code as our integrated development environment, which enabled us to work efficiently and collaboratively. Our timeline was well-structured, with regular check-ins and milestones to ensure we stayed on track.
Challenges Overcome
One of the significant challenges we faced was managing our different time zones, as well as balancing our responsibilities, including family, lifestyle, and work commitments. To overcome this, we established a clear communication plan, utilizing tools like Slack and Trello to stay connected and organized.

Learnings about Technical Interests 
Through this project, I gained a deeper understanding of the software engineering process, likening it to a chef who writes recipes, follows rules of engagement, and takes pride in the outcome. This experience has solidified my interest in software engineering and has given me a sense of accomplishment, much like a chef presenting a finished dish.
